				<p class="f_r">"AFTER DECIDING TO GET INTO RUNNING, IT BECAME AN ADDICTION FOR THE EVER-FOCUSED SHEFFIELD BORN POLLY, CONSISTENTLY SETTING HERSELF NEW CHALLENGES — THE MOST RECENT OF WHICH WAS CONQUERING THE LONDON MARATHON. A KEEN BLOGGER — YOU CAN EXPECT HEALTHY RECIPES, PRODUCT REVIEWS, HOW SHE’S PREPPING FOR A RACE AND THE LITTLE NIGGLES THAT RUNNERS DON’T NORMALLY TELL YOU ABOUT. IN HER OWN WORDS, “THE FEELING OF REACHING A GOAL IS AMAZING BUT GOALS DO EXIST TO BE MET, SO IT IS TIME TO SET A NEW ONE."</p>
