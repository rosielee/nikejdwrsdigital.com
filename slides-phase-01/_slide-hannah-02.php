				<p class="f_r">"FROM INTERNATIONAL PARTY GIRL TO FITNESS FREAK. PR COORDINATOR HANNAH WAS CHALLENGED BY A FRIEND IN 2014 TO RUN THE MARATHON AND SINCE THEN HASN'T LOOKED BACK. LATE NIGHTS WERE REPLACED WITH LONG MORNING RUNS AND A HEFTY MIXTURE OF YOGA AND SPINNING, NONE OF WHICH CAN BE TACKLED WITHOUT HER BELOVED MUSIC. BOASTING A MORE POSITIVE OUTLOOK ON LIFE SINCE TAKING UP RUNNING, A SCROLL THROUGH HANNAH'S INSTAGRAM FEED WILL CONVEY JUST HOW SHE MAKES RUNNING A KEY PART OF HER LIFESTYLE AS SHE TRAVELS THE GLOBE COMPETING."</p>
